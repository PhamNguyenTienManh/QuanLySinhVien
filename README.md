The Student Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the interaction between administrators, teachers, and students within an academic environment. The system enables administrators to manage courses, teachers, and student enrollments efficiently, while teachers can post assignments, grade submissions, and facilitate discussions through an integrated forum.

A key feature of the project is its integration with Google Drive, allowing teachers to upload assignments and students to submit their work directly through the Drive API, with real-time synchronization and data display on the application. Additionally, the system incorporates facial recognition authentication to enhance security and simplify the login process for both teachers and students.
